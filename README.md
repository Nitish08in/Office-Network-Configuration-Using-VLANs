# Office-Network-Configuration-Using-VLANs
This project involves configuring an office network using VLANs to improve network efficiency and security. By segmenting the network into different VLANs, we can control traffic, reduce broadcast domains, and enhance the overall performance of the network. Inter-VLAN routing is configured to allow communication between different VLANs, and DHCP.
