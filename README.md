# Office-Network-Configuration-Using-VLANs

# Project Description
This project, completed between April 2024 and May 2024 in association with Engineers India Limited, focuses on configuring an office network using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs). The primary objective was to optimize network performance and enhance security through advanced network segmentation techniques. Key methodologies included inter-VLAN routing and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for efficient IP management.

# Objectives
- Design and implement VLANs to segment the office network.
- Configure inter-VLAN routing to enable communication between different VLANs.
- Utilize DHCP to automate IP address assignment and management.
- Enhance network security and performance through effective network segmentation.
